Hello! I'm Stephanie Towch, a PhD student in Psychology at Birkbeck, University of London. The Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) is funding my research in work addiction, health and wellbeing. I'm a Graduate Member of the British Psychological Society (GMBPsS) and the European Association of Work and Organizational Psychology (EAWOP). Before academia, I worked in investment banking across finance technology, project management and commodities operations. I'm a big fan of quantitative research, psychometrics and machine learning. Here are some of the projects I've worked on over the years.
