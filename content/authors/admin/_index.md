Hello! I'm Stephanie Towch, a PhD student in Psychology at Birkbeck, University of London. The Economic and Social Research Council ([ESRC](https://www.ukri.org/councils/esrc/)) is funding my research in work addiction, health and wellbeing. I'm a Graduate Member of the [British Psychological Society](https://www.bps.org.uk/) (GMBPsS) and the [European Association of Work and Organizational Psychology](http://www.eawop.org) (EAWOP). Before academia, I worked in investment banking across finance technology, project management and commodities operations. I'm a big fan of quantitative research, psychometrics and machine learning. Here are some of the projects I've worked on over the years.
