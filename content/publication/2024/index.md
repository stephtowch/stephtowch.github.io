**Abstract**
{style="text-align: center;"}

In today’s productivity-driven workplaces, work addiction has garnered attention. Despite consensus 
on the conceptual validity of certain behavioural addictions, work addiction remains unrecognised in 
diagnostic manuals. This study examined the relationship between work addiction and burnout via 
psychological capital (PsyCap) and job satisfaction. A sample of 454 employed adults (71.1% females, 
aged 19–72 years, M = 32.55 years, SD = 10.56) from 52 countries were recruited online. A serial 
mediation analysis using structural equation modelling tested paths from work addiction to PsyCap 
to job satisfaction to burnout. The study revealed a positive association between work addiction and 
burnout. PsyCap and job satisfaction partially mediated the relationship, with work addiction prevalence 
at 28.4%. Work addiction emerges as a significant stressor with potentially adverse effects on individual 
well-being globally. Interventions focused on enhancing PsyCap and job satisfaction may mitigate these 
effects and their association with burnout. The implications of these findings are further discussed.
