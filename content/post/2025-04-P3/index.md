🌀 **Because procrastination is fine... as long as it’s cleverly disguised as progress.**

Let’s face it, doing a PhD means constantly negotiating with your to-do list. And sometimes, those negotiations result in... creative detours. 

Here are a few of my top-tier *“productive”* procrastination strategies:

## 🧠 1. Switching Studies  
Putting off a difficult task on one study… by working on another study that’s way more interesting.  

Still research. Still progress. Technically not avoidance, right?

## 💸 2. Participating in Other People’s Research  
Yes, I’m procrastinating, but I’m helping *science*. And getting paid. 

That’s monetising my productivity, thank you very much!

## 🏃‍♀️ 3. Prioritising My Physical Fitness  
Going to the gym or out for a walk.

It’s part of my academic stamina plan. A PhD is a marathon, not a sprint!

## 📖 4. Blog > Papers  
“I *should* have finished reading all those papers by now...” But instead, I’m writing a blog post about my research life. 

That’s research dissemination, obviously.

## 📚 5. Planning My Future PhD Outline 
Revisiting my PhD outline and planning future studies. 

Am I avoiding today’s to-do list? Yes... but I’m *strategising for tomorrow’s* (or the next year).

🎓 **Procrastination? Sure. But it’s productive... sort of.**  

Sometimes avoiding one task leads to surprising progress elsewhere.
