Presenting at the First EAWOP Small Group Meeting on Workaholism Research in Gdańsk





On September 25–26, 2025, I had the privilege of presenting my research at the EAWOP Small Group Meeting (SGM) “Advancing Workaholism Research: Setting the Stage for Organizational Prevention” at the University of Gdańsk. This was a particularly special experience: not only was it my second international conference presentation, but it was also the first ever meeting dedicated solely to workaholism research.





Setting the Scene





The meeting was hosted at the Faculty of Languages at the University of Gdańsk, bringing together leading scholars in the field of work and organizational psychology. From the opening keynote on “The Workaholism Paradox” by Arnold Bakker to studies on leadership, daily work dynamics, and cross-cultural perspectives, the program offered a comprehensive exploration of workaholism.



What made this meeting stand out was not just the high-quality research but also its forward-looking purpose: to establish a policy document and potentially a special journal issue, aiming to highlight workaholism as a genuine societal and organizational problem requiring intervention.





My Presentation





I was honored to be the first presenter on Day 2, where I shared my project:



“The measurement of work addiction: The International Work Addiction Scale (IWAS-7) versus the Bergen Work Addiction Scale (BWAS) in a nationally representative sample.”



As a PhD student, it was both nerve-wracking and exciting to present to such an expert audience. The feedback I received was incredibly valuable—not only for refining my methodology but also for thinking about how measurement tools can support future interventions and policy.





Learning from the Community





The SGM was more than a series of presentations—it felt like the beginning of a collective movement to ensure workaholism is recognized as a critical issue in organizational psychology and public health.



Highlights for me included:



Discussions on how leadership styles and organizational culture contribute to workaholism,
Longitudinal studies showing its links to job insecurity and burnout,
Cross-cultural research that broadened our understanding of work addiction worldwide.




These conversations will shape how researchers, practitioners, and policymakers address the issue in the years ahead.





Reflections as a PhD Student





For me, the conference was an extraordinary learning experience. Presenting my work in this pioneering context helped me see how my research can fit into the bigger picture of prevention, policy, and practice. It also gave me the chance to learn directly from established scholars, exchange ideas with peers, and gain insights that will strengthen my future projects.





Looking Ahead





I left Gdańsk feeling both inspired and grateful: inspired by the groundbreaking discussions that took place, and grateful for the opportunity to be part of this milestone in the field so early in my academic journey.



I look forward to contributing to the growing conversation on workaholism, supporting the development of prevention strategies, and continuing to collaborate with this vibrant community of researchers.







✨ This meeting made clear that workaholism is not just an academic curiosity—it’s a pressing problem that requires serious attention, evidence-based prevention, and organizational action.
