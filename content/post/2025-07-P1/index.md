## What Is a Systematic Review?

A systematic review is a rigorous and transparent method of identifying, evaluating, and synthesising all available research on a particular question. Unlike traditional or narrative reviews, systematic reviews follow a predefined protocol, reducing bias and increasing reproducibility.

They are widely used in fields like healthcare, education, and psychology to provide evidence-based conclusions that inform policy, practice, and further research.

## Step-by-Step: How to Conduct a Systematic Review

### 1. Define a Clear Research Question

Use a structured framework like **PICOSS** to formulate your research question. This approach ensures clarity and relevance in your systematic review design.

**PICOSS stands for:**
- **Population**: Who is being studied?
- **Intervention**: What is the main intervention or exposure?
- **Comparison**: Is there a control or alternative?
- **Outcome**: What are the expected results?
- **Study design**: What types of studies will be included?
- **Setting**: In what context or environment are studies conducted?

**Example (PICOSS format):**
- **Population**: Working adults in high-stress industries  
- **Intervention**: Cognitive-behavioural stress management programs  
- **Comparison**: No intervention or standard wellness program  
- **Outcome**: Reduction in self-reported burnout levels  
- **Study design**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental studies  
- **Setting**: Corporate workplaces in OECD countries  

**Resulting research question:**  
*Do cognitive-behavioural stress management programs reduce burnout levels among working adults in high-stress industries compared to no intervention or standard wellness programs in corporate settings?*

### 2. Develop and Register a Protocol

Create a protocol outlining your objectives, inclusion/exclusion criteria, databases to be searched, and methods for data extraction and synthesis. Register it on **PROSPERO** or the **Open Science Framework** to enhance transparency and avoid duplication.

---

### 3. Perform a Comprehensive Literature Search

Search multiple databases such as:

- PubMed  
- Embase  
- Cochrane Library  
- PsycINFO  
- Scopus  
- Web of Science  

Use Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT), keywords, and controlled vocabulary like MeSH terms. Document your search strategy carefully.

---

### 4. Screen and Select Studies

- **Title and abstract screening** to eliminate irrelevant studies.  
- **Full-text screening** for eligibility based on inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
Use two independent reviewers and resolve disagreements through discussion or a third reviewer.

---

### 5. Extract Data Systematically

Develop a standardized data extraction form and collect:

- Study characteristics (authors, year, country)  
- Sample details and methods  
- Interventions and outcomes  
- Key results and effect sizes  
- Quality or risk of bias assessments

---

### 6. Assess Quality and Risk of Bias

Choose appropriate tools such as:

- **Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool** (for RCTs)  
- **Newcastle-Ottawa Scale** (for observational studies)  
- **CASP checklists**  

This ensures you can evaluate the strength and reliability of the evidence.

---

### 7. Synthesise the Findings

- **Narrative synthesis** for qualitative reviews  
- **Meta-analysis** for quantitative reviews using statistical methods  
Assess heterogeneity, consider subgroup analyses, and report findings in a structured format.

---

### 8. Report Using PRISMA Guidelines

Use the **PRISMA** checklist and flow diagram to ensure completeness and transparency. Your report should include:

- Search strategy  
- Study selection flowchart  
- Summary tables  
- Risk of bias assessments  
- Discussion of limitations and implications

Publish your review in a relevant journal or share it via institutional repositories.

## Final Thoughts

Systematic reviews are a cornerstone of evidence-based research. Although they are time-intensive, the process deepens your understanding of your topic and contributes valuable insights to your field. With careful planning, collaboration, and adherence to reporting standards, your systematic review can have lasting academic impact.
