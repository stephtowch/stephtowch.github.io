description: "How an unexpected interest in psychology turned into a research journey—from short courses to a PhD focused on behavioural addiction."

title: It was never the plan, but here I am, doing a PhD
---

**Thinking about doing a PhD but unsure if it’s for you?**  

My journey into doctoral research wasn’t part of some master plan. It started in 2018, when I signed up for a few short courses in psychology at [Birkbeck, University of London](https://www.bbk.ac.uk/prospective/short-courses) mostly out of curiosity and a bit of uncertainty. I wasn’t sure if I’d complete them, but they opened a door I never saw coming.

## From curiosity to commitment  

What followed was a full MSc in Psychology, then a second MSc in Organisational Psychology, where I first came across the topic of work addiction (or workaholism). That research project stuck with me, not just because of the content, but because of what was *missing* from it. The lack of UK-based research, the absence of work addiction from diagnostic manuals… I couldn’t let it go.

> *“The more I learned, the more I wanted to know.”*

## Why I chose to keep studying  

That’s when I realised... I didn’t just want to learn about behavioural addiction research, I wanted to contribute to it. I wanted to fill the gaps, ask new questions and share my perspective through research.

This wasn’t my first career. I’d spent over 15 years working in finance, and while it gave me valuable experience, I was increasingly drawn to understanding *why* people work the way they do, not just how. That shift in perspective was subtle at first, but it grew stronger the more I studied.

And Ironically, study addiction has been identified as a precursor to work addiction ([Atroszko, 2016](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27842448/)). I didn’t realise that at the time, but in hindsight, it makes a lot of sense! What started as curiosity became a deepening need to understand human behaviour, and now, a drive to contribute.

## Where I am now  

Now, I’m in the second year of my PhD in Psychology at Birkbeck, with a few research projects on the go and even more questions driving me forward. It’s still not always easy to explain *why* I chose this path, especially when it wasn’t the original plan, but I know I’m where I’m supposed to be.

If you’ve taken a similar unexpected path, or are starting to wonder if research might be for you, I’d love to hear your story too.
