summary: "I never planned to do a PhD. But curiosity, short courses, and a growing interest in psychology turned into two MScs—and eventually, doctoral research in behavioural addiction."

**Thinking about doing a PhD in psychology but unsure if it’s for you?**  

My journey into doctoral research wasn’t part of some master plan. It started in 2018, when I signed up for a few evening psychology courses at [Birkbeck, University of London](https://www.bbk.ac.uk/prospective/short-courses) mostly out of curiosity and uncertainty. I wasn’t sure if I’d complete them, but they opened a door I never saw coming.

What followed was a full MSc in Psychology, then a second MSc in Organisational Psychology, where I first came across the topic of work addiction (or workaholism). That research project stuck with me, not just because of the content, but because of what was *missing* from it. The lack of UK-based research, the absence of work addiction from diagnostic manuals… I couldn’t let it go.

> *“The more I learned, the more I wanted to know.”*

That’s when I realised... I didn’t just want to learn about behavioural addiction, I wanted to contribute to it. I wanted to fill the gaps, ask new questions, and share my perspective through research.

Now, I’m in the second year of my PhD in Psychology, with a few projects underway and many more questions in mind. It’s still not always easy to explain *why* I chose this path, especially when it wasn’t the original goal, but I know I’m in the right place.

### *“It was never the plan. But here I am, doing a PhD.”*

If you’ve taken a similar unexpected path, or are just starting to wonder if research might be for you, I’d love to hear your story too.
