## Introducing the Burnout Syndrome Test (BST): A New Way to Measure Burnout

Burnout is more than just feeling tired after a long week. It's a serious issue with wide-reaching effects. The World Health Organization (WHO) officially recognises burnout in its International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11), as an occupational phenomenon caused by chronic workplace stress that hasnâ€™t been successfully managed.

According to the WHO, burnout has three key features:

- **Exhaustion or energy depletion**
- **Mental distance from work or increased cynicism**
- **Feelings of ineffectiveness and lack of accomplishment**

Despite decades of research, existing tools havenâ€™t fully caught up with this modern definition. Most burnout assessments still reflect older frameworks, which means they donâ€™t always capture what the WHO now considers core to the condition.

---

## Our New Study

To bridge this gap, I recently led a study to develop a new tool: the **Burnout Syndrome Test (BST)**. Itâ€™s a standardised, scientifically validated way to measure burnout based specifically on the WHOâ€™s updated definition.

We tested the BST on two groups in the UK:

- A general employee group of 245 people (average age: 29)
- A nationally representative sample of over 1,000 people (focus on 758 employed individuals, average age: 45)

Our analysis confirmed that the BST effectively captures the three key burnout dimensions (exhaustion, mental distance, and ineffectiveness). We also tested whether the BST worked similarly for men and women, and it did. Burnout levels didnâ€™t significantly differ by gender in our national sample.

## Why This Matters

In the nationally representative sample, about **15%** of people met criteria for burnout using the BST. Thatâ€™s a substantial portion of the workforce.

The BST is short, reliable, and grounded in the latest clinical understanding of burnout. It offers researchers, HR professionals, and clinicians a new way to identify and track burnout. This approach aligns with how experts now define the condition.

## Final Thoughts

Burnout isnâ€™t just about stress. Itâ€™s a measurable, diagnosable syndrome that deserves accurate tools for detection. Iâ€™m proud to contribute a step forward in how we understand and assess it. I hope the BST will help create clearer insights, more targeted interventions, and ultimately, healthier workplaces.
