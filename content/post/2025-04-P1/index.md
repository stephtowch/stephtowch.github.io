title: Understanding the link between work addiction and burnout
---

In our latest research, titled [**Exploring the Relationship Between Work Addiction and Burnout**](https://rdcu.be/dVKtf), we delved into 
how work addiction can lead to burnout, highlighting the role of psychological resources in mitigating this growing issue. 
We surveyed 454 employees across 52 countries to understand how an unhealthy compulsion to overwork contributes to burnout.

## What is work addiction?

Work addiction, often called workaholism, is a psychological condition where individuals feel an overwhelming urge to work excessively, 
beyond what is healthy or sustainable. It's not just about long hours or passion for the job; it's when work becomes a compulsive behaviour 
that takes over one's life. People with work addiction often use work as a way to cope with stress, anxiety or feelings of inadequacy. 
This can result in neglecting health, relationships and personal interests in favour of work. Even when individuals recognise the negative 
impacts, they find it difficult to reduce their working hours, leading to emotional exhaustion and lower psychological well-being.

## About our study's findings

In our study, we found that nearly 28% of participants exhibited signs of work addiction, with fewer than 4% meeting the criteria for severe 
addiction. Those struggling with work addiction often experience burnout, which manifests in emotional, physical and mental exhaustion, 
feelings of inadequacy and increased cynicism toward their jobs.

However, we discovered that individuals with high psychological capital (positive mental traits such as self-confidence, hope, optimism and 
resilience) were better able to handle the pressures of work addiction. This resilience significantly lowered their risk of burnout. 
While job satisfaction also offered some protective benefits, it wasnâ€™t sufficient on its own for those already battling work addiction.

Our findings stress the importance of recognising work addiction as a serious mental health issue in the workplace. Although job satisfaction
and psychological resources can help alleviate burnout, the strong link between work addiction and burnout remains concerning. 
Other factors, such as individual coping mechanisms and workplace culture, also play significant roles.

While psychological capital and job satisfaction offer some protection, our research shows that they alone are not enough to fully prevent 
burnout in those struggling with work addiction. We believe that workplace environments have a substantial impact on burnout in individuals 
experiencing work addiction. Further research is needed to explore these factors and develop effective strategies for enhancing wellbeing 
at work.

## Implications for our findings

The implications of our research are highly relevant for both individuals and employers. It is crucial for both employers and employees to recognise 
the risks of work addiction and its long-term impact on mental health. By strengthening psychological resources such as hope, self-efficacy, resilience, 
and optimism, workplaces can take proactive steps to address work addiction and prevent burnout, fostering healthier work habits and a more balanced work-life 
dynamic.
