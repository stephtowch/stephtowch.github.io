## No Coding Background, No Problem: How I Taught Myself R for My MSc Thesis

When I began my MSc Psychology thesis, I had no experience coding. I wasnâ€™t from a data science background, hadnâ€™t taken any classes and was used to working in Excel and SPSS. But my project involved **Structural Equation Modelling (SEM)** and I quickly realised: SPSS wasnâ€™t going to do what I needed.

So I pivoted and decided to learn **R**.

### Why R?

R is free, powerful and widely used in psychological and social science research. Iâ€™d heard of packages like `lavaan` for SEM and knew others had used it for thesis projects. What I didnâ€™t have was any coding experience. But I was determined to make it work!

### How I Learned (Without Formal Training)

I taught myself R entirely through self-directed learning, using:

- ðŸŽ¥ **YouTube tutorials** to walk through real coding workflows and examples
- ðŸ“š **Blog posts and online guides** to understand structure and logic  
- ðŸ¤– **ChatGPT** to help me debug and explain errors in plain English
- ðŸ’¬ **R documentation and Stack Overflow** whenever I got stuck  

It was like learning a new language... At times it felt overwhelming, but it was also incredibly satisfying. Every small success boosted my confidence.

By the end of the project, I had learned how to:

- Import, clean and transform data using `tidyverse`  
- Visualise data with `ggplot2`  
- Conduct SEM analyses using `lavaan`  
- Interpret and write up results for a formal academic thesis  

### What Happened After the Thesis?

Something unexpected: I realised I actually liked the challenge of coding. It pushed me to think differently and gave me a new way to approach problems.

After submitting my thesis, I enrolled in a couple of courses at the **[Essex Summer School](https://essexsummerschool.com/)** in Social Science Data Analysis, where I deepened my R skills in an intensive, hands-on setting. I took a Web Scraping and Data Management course where I learned SQL, and later solidified that learning in a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and SEM class the following summer. These experiences helped me gain confidence in applying more complex methods and managing data more efficiently.

Iâ€™ll be returning again this year to explore **machine learning** and more advanced statistical techniques.

In the meantime, Iâ€™ve also started learning Python to broaden my data analysis capabilities and explore areas like automation, NLP and applied research.

### Can You Learn to Code in Your 30s or 40s?

Absolutely.

You donâ€™t need to be a programmer. You donâ€™t need a computer science background. What you do need is curiosity, persistence and a clear reason to start.

Learning to code in my 40s wasnâ€™t just doable, itâ€™s become one of the most empowering parts of my academic journey. What began as a necessity for my thesis has evolved into a long-term passion and a completely new skill set.
