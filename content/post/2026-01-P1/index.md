## Can You Measure Work Addiction?

  We often praise people for working hard. But for some, work stops being a choice and becomes a compulsion, harming health, relationships, and wellbeing. This pattern is known as work addiction (or workaholism). Despite increasing research attention, it is still not formally recognised in diagnostic manuals.

  That makes good measurement especially important.

  ## What Is Work Addiction?

  Work addiction isn’t just about long hours or ambition. It involves a loss of control over work, where people feel driven to work even when it causes problems.

  It follows the same core features seen in other addictions and  can show up in everyday life in ways like:
  
  - Work taking over your thoughts, even when you’re off work, on holiday, or trying to sleep
  - Needing to work more and more to feel satisfied or at ease
  - Using work to cope with emotions, such as guilt, anxiety, stress, or low mood
  - Trying to cut back on work but not being able to, even when you want to
  - Feeling stressed or uncomfortable when you can’t work#
  - Letting work crowd out other parts of life, like family, friends, hobbies, or rest
  - Continuing to overwork despite harm, such as negative effects on physical or mental health

  The International Work Addiction Scale (IWAS) was designed to measure these patterns in a short, theory-based way.

  ## What We Did

  We validated two versions of the International Work Addiction Scale:

  - the 7-item version (IWAS-7)  
  - the shorter 5-item version (IWAS-5)  

  Data were collected from two UK samples, including a nationally representative group. To improve validity, analyses focused on 764 employed adults.

  ## What We Found

  - Both versions measured one clear underlying construct: work addiction  
  - The scales were reliable and valid, and aligned well with an existing work addiction measure  
  - They worked equally well for men and women, with no gender differences in underlying levels  
  - The 7-item scale was especially effective at identifying moderate to high levels of work addiction, particularly items related to conflict, relapse, and real-world problems  

  ## Why This Matters

  Not all hard work is unhealthy. What distinguishes work addiction is compulsion, loss of control, and harm — not simply long hours or high commitment.

  The IWAS offers a quick and reliable way to assess work addiction without confusing it with healthy engagement. In cultures where overwork is often normalised or rewarded, having a sound tool to identify when work becomes harmful is an important step forward.

  ## What’s Next

  Work addiction remains an emerging area of research. Reliable measurement is foundational for improving theory, advancing research, and informing discussions about work and wellbeing.

  The International Work Addiction Scale provides a validated tool for use in the UK, consistent with the components model of addiction. The full paper with technical details and methodology will be available soon.

  Do you think overwork is normalised in your workplace? How should organisations respond when work becomes harmful? I’d love to hear your thoughts.
